# Utopia-Engine
A program version of the amazing print at home solo game.
To see/ play Nick Hayes amazing game, check out the page at board game geek: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/75223/utopia-engine

This project is my first real shot at making a program by my lonesum and not off a tutorial, so please be gentle.

as of now (9/25/2020) this is still very much a work in progress and not even a little bit finished.

10/8: Getting there! Saving works. Loading is getting there. You can now get to "the end" of the game, though it's underwheming. Gotta add items, the ability to lose and a lot more UX!
